      <p>Double-clicking between a square pointer and a square pointer will add a new square pointer. Double-clicking on a square pointer will add a circle pointer to control the curve.</p>
      <p>Select either the square pointer or the circle pointer, and press the Delete button to delete the selected pointer.</p>
      <p>If you want to cut out or merge paths, select the base shape, and then select the shape you want to merge while holding down Shift on your keyboard.</p>
      <p>Finally, right click on the "Integrating paths" menu to integrate the path information into the base selected shape.</p>
